Template of the bot, you must add your own images and complement code.

Place the image of whatever you want to make click on in the same folder of bot.py

Make sure to take the screenshot of the image (before the cut) with the same size of your dofus window size , for example if you play fullscreen, the image's cut must be taken in fullscreen too. if you play in a tiny window, the image must be cut from a screenshot with the same tiny window of your game.
